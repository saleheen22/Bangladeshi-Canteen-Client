                <h4>Differences between Controlled and Uncontrolled Components</h4>
                <p>Ans: <br></br>

                The data from the form element is handled by the React component (not the DOM) in a controlled component and maintained in the component's state. In essence, a controlled component overrides the HTML form components' default behavior.
                <br />
                On the other hand, Uncontrolled components are those that render form elements and let the DOM handle the form element's data by default. You may use a ref to gain access to the input's DOM node and retrieve its value.

                <h4>How to validate React props using PropTypes?
                </h4>
                <p>
                Here are some steps. <br></br>
                1.Import PropTypes from the 'prop-types' package. <br></br>
                2.Define the anticipated data type for each prop and indicate whether it is necessary or not.<br></br>
                3.Put the PropTypes object in your component's propTypes property.

                <h4>Difference Between Node js and Express js</h4>
                <p>
                JavaScript-based server-side event-driven i/o applications may be built using the Node.js platform. <br />
                On the other hand, The Node.js-based Express.js framework is used to create web applications utilizing the event-driven architectural methods and ideas.

                    What is a custom hook? Why wil you create a custom hook?
                </h4>
                <p>
                A JavaScript function with the word "use" at the beginning and the ability to call other Hooks is known as a custom hook. <br></br>
                To transfer stateful functionality between components in a reusable and manageable manner, custom hooks are mostly used in React. Using custom hooks, programmers can transform complex logic into reusable functions that are simple for many components to consume.
